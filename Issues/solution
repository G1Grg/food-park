While checking for forget password and reset password, there was the following error:
"Trying to access array offset on null"

This situation is related to connection to the smtp. For this instance: mailtrap

Solution:
Ensure you select the correct version of laravel
Copy and paste the configuration.
If password has \*\*\*\*, that is what has caused the error.
